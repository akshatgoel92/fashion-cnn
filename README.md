# Readme

- This repository contains code to learn Tensorflow by implementing different deep learning models using the Fashion MNIST dataset from Zalando.

- The implementations were created while going through the book 'Introduction to Deep Learning' by Eugene Charniak. 

- For more about the Zalando dataset please look at [this link](https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/fashion-mnist/). 

- To run this code you must have the Jupyter notebook environment installed. 

- The dependencies are given at the top of each notebook.
